# Traffic Accident Hotspot Clustering and Visualization System

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to analyze Los Angeles traffic collision data (2010-2025) to identify urban safety hotspots and accident patterns. The system will use DBSCAN clustering to identify spatial-temporal patterns and provide interactive visualizations through a Streamlit web application.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Data Quality:
   - Handling invalid coordinates (0°, 0°)
   - Managing large dataset efficiently
   - Ensuring proper data types and formats

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Creating meaningful spatial grid features
   - Balancing grid size for meaningful clustering
   - Incorporating temporal patterns

3. Clustering:
   - Choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters
   - Handling spatial and temporal features together
   - Dealing with noise points effectively

4. Visualization:
   - Creating interactive and informative maps
   - Designing clear cluster comparison visualizations
   - Ensuring smooth performance with large datasets
